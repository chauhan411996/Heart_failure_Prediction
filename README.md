Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

This Web App is used to predict whether you are safe or you are at risk with the help of some input parameters i.e, age,sex,platelets,follow up period and so on.
